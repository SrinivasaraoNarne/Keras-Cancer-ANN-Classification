# Cancer Classification Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
This repository contains a project aimed at classifying cancer types using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) implemented in Python with Keras. The project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques for binary classification based on labeled medical data.
# Overview
Cancer classification is a critical task in the field of medical diagnostics. This project utilizes a dataset containing features extracted from cancer cells to predict whether the cells are benign or malignant. The model is built using a Sequential ANN architecture in Keras and is trained on the labeled dataset to achieve accurate predictions.
# Features
  * Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling for optimal model performance.
  * ANN Architecture:
    * Input Layer: Accepts multiple features of the dataset.
    * Hidden Layers: Dense layers with ReLU activation for feature learning.
    * Output Layer: Sigmoid activation for binary classification.
  * Performance Metrics: Evaluates the model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
  * Visualization: Includes loss and accuracy plots for training and testing phases.
# Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains features extracted from cancer cell nuclei, such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, and smoothness. It is a clean and labeled dataset suitable for binary classification.
