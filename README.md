# Cancer Classification Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

## Introduction
This repository contains a deep learning project focused on classifying cancer types using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Implemented in Python with Keras, the project demonstrates how deep learning techniques can be applied to binary classification tasks in medical diagnostics.

## Overview
Cancer classification plays a vital role in medical diagnostics, aiding in the early detection and treatment of the disease. This project utilizes a dataset containing extracted features from cancer cells to predict whether they are benign or malignant. The model is built using a Sequential ANN architecture in Keras and is trained on labeled medical data to optimize prediction accuracy.

## Features
  * Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling for optimal model performance.
  * ANN Architecture:
    * Input Layer: Accepts multiple features of the dataset.
    * Hidden Layers: Dense layers with ReLU activation for feature learning.
    * Output Layer: Sigmoid activation for binary classification.
  * Performance Metrics: Evaluates the model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
  * Visualization: Includes loss and accuracy plots for training and testing phases.
# Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains features extracted from cancer cell nuclei, such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, and smoothness. It is a clean and labeled dataset suitable for binary classification.
