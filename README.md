# Cancer Classification Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
This repository contains a project aimed at classifying cancer types using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) implemented in Python with Keras. The project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques for binary classification based on labeled medical data.
# Overview
Cancer classification is a critical task in the field of medical diagnostics. This project utilizes a dataset containing features extracted from cancer cells to predict whether the cells are benign or malignant. The model is built using a Sequential ANN architecture in Keras and is trained on the labeled dataset to achieve accurate predictions.
